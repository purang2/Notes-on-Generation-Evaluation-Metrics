# Notes-on-Generation-Evaluation-Metrics

### Overview


> Natural language generation (NLG) is one of the most active research fields in NLP. Yet, much of the work is focused on English, and too little attention is given to evaluation processes. As many of the recent developments in few-shot and in-context learning have led to the treatment of many tasks as text generation problems, the need for better NLG evaluation processes is becoming more urgent.

So, we need metrics and I'll study about Generation, Evaluation &amp; Metrics (GEM) for NLG.ðŸ˜Š

I'll write down in this repository.
